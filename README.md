# Copy-Image
Right-click and copy the image, not the file, for pasting into other apps.

### Instructions
After installing Copy-Image, there should be a "Copy Image" option when right-clicking PNG or JPG files.  
* If the option is missing, reset your program defaults and reinstall Copy-Image.
* To reset program defaults in Windows 10, go to Settings - System - Default apps. The Reset button is at the bottom.
